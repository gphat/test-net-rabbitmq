=head1 NAME

Test::Net::RabbitMQ - A mock RabbitMQ implementation for use when testing.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Net::RabbitMQ;

    my $mq = Test::Net::RabbitMQ->new;

    $mq->connect;

    $mq->channel_open(1);

    $mq->exchange_declare(1, 'order');
    $mq->queue_declare(1, 'new-orders');

    $mq->queue_bind(1, 'new-orders', 'order', 'order.new');

    $mq->publish(1, 'order.new', 'hello!', { exchange => 'order' });

    $mq->consume(1, 'new-orders');

    my $msg = $mq->recv;
    
    # Or
    
    my $msg = $mq->get(1, 'order.new', {});

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Net::RabbitMQ is a terrible approximation of using the real thing, but
hopefully will allow you to test systems that use L<Net::RabbitMQ> without
having to use an actual RabbitMQ instance.

The general overview is that calls to C<publish> pushes a message into one
or more queues (or none if there are no bindings) and calls to C<recv>
pop them.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module has all the features I've needed to successfully test our 
RabbitMQ-using application. Patches are welcome if I'm missing something you
need! At the moment there are a number of shortcomings:

=over 4

=item C<recv> doesn't block

=item exchanges are all topic

=item lots of other stuff!

=back
 
=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 connectable

If false then any calls to connect will die to emulate a failed connection.

=head2 debug

If set to true (which you can do at any time) then a message will be emmitted
to STDERR any time a message is added to a queue.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 channel_open($number)

Opens a channel with the specific number.

=head2 channel_close($number)

Closes the specific channel.

=head2 connect

Connects this instance.  Does nothing except set C<connected> to true.  Will
throw an exception if you've set C<connectable> to false.

=head2 consume($channel, $queue)

Sets the queue that will be popped when C<recv> is called.

=head2 disconnect

Disconnects this instance by setting C<connected> to false.

=head2 exchange_declare($channel, $exchange, $options)

Creates an exchange of the specified name.

=head2 get ($channel, $queue, $options)

Get a message from the queue, if there is one.

Like C<Net::RabbitMQ>, this will return a hash containing the following
information:

     {
       body => 'Magic Transient Payload', # the reconstructed body
       routing_key => 'nr_test_q',        # route the message took
       exchange => 'nr_test_x',           # exchange used
       delivery_tag => 1,                 # (inc'd every recv or get)
       redelivered => 0,                  # always 0
       message_count => 0,                # always 0
     }

=head2 tx_select($channel)

Begins a transaction on the specified channel.  From this point forward all
publish() calls on the channel will be buffered until a call to L</tx_commit>
or L</tx_rollback> is made.

=head2 tx_commit($channel)

Commits a transaction on the specified channel, causing all buffered publish()
calls to this point to be published.

=head2 tx_rollback($channel)

Rolls the transaction back, causing all buffered publish() calls to be wiped.

=head2 queue_bind($channel, $queue, $exchange, $routing_key)

Binds the specified queue to the specified exchange using the provided
routing key.  B<Note that, at the moment, this doesn't work with AMQP wildcards.
Only with exact matches of the routing key.>

=head2 queue_declare($channel, $queue, $options)

Creates a queue of the specified name.

=head2 queue_unbind($channel, $queue, $exchange, $routing_key)

Unbinds the specified routing key from the provided queue and exchange.

=head2 publish($channel, $routing_key, $body, $options)

Publishes the specified body with the supplied routing key.  If there is a
binding that matches then the message will be added to the appropriate queue(s).

=head2 recv

Provided you've called C<consume> then calls to recv will C<pop> the next
message of the queue.  B<Note that this method does not block.>

Like C<Net::RabbitMQ>, this will return a hash containing the following
information:

     {
       body => 'Magic Transient Payload', # the reconstructed body
       routing_key => 'nr_test_q',        # route the message took
       exchange => 'nr_test_x',           # exchange used
       delivery_tag => 1,                 # (inc'd every recv or get)
       consumer_tag => '',                # Always blank currently
       props => $props,                   # hashref sent in
     }
